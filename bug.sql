The following SQL query is prone to a subtle error related to implicit type conversion and how NULL values are handled:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = '10';
```

**Problem:**
The `department_id` column might be an integer type, but the query uses a string literal ('10').  Most SQL databases will perform an implicit type conversion, which can lead to unexpected results, especially if there are `NULL` values in the `department_id` column.  The comparison `department_id = '10'` might not treat `NULL` values as equal to anything, including the string '10', even after implicit conversion.  This can result in omitting relevant rows where `department_id` is `NULL`.

**Uncommon Aspect:**  The bug is not a straightforward syntax error or a common logic flaw. It's subtle because it exploits implicit type conversion and the unique behavior of `NULL` in comparisons. The error manifests primarily when `NULL` values are present and the database's handling of implicit type conversion is not well-understood.

**Example:**  Imagine `department_id` is `NULL` in some rows. The query would not return these rows, even if the database performs an implicit conversion of '10' to an integer. The comparison `NULL = 10` evaluates to `UNKNOWN`, which is treated as `false` in a `WHERE` clause.
