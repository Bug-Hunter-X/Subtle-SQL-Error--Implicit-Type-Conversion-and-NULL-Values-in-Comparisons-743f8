The corrected SQL query explicitly handles the case where `department_id` might be NULL and uses an explicit type conversion to avoid implicit conversions:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10 OR department_id IS NULL;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Explicit Type Conversion:** Removed the quotes around '10' to ensure a direct comparison between integers.  Implicit conversion becomes unnecessary. 
*   **Handling NULLs:** The addition of `OR department_id IS NULL` explicitly includes rows where `department_id` is NULL, preventing the accidental omission of data.

This approach guarantees that all rows with `department_id` equal to 10, and those with `department_id` as `NULL`, are included in the results.
